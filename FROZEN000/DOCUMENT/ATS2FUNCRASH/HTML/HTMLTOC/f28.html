>&#13;This book consists of a set of lecture notes for a crash course on
functional programming in ATS. The primary focus of these notes is set
upon advocating a style of problem-solving that makes extensive use of
list-processing, array-processing and stream-processing functions. In
addition, a so-called <SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"
>build-your-own-library</I
></SPAN
> approach to
teaching/learning programming is adopted here to greatly enhance the
opportunity for one to make genuine use of those library functions
implemented by oneself and thus learn first-handedly from one's own
mistakes.

>&#13;The average reader is expected to have already had some exposure
to programming (e.g., having taken one semester of programming course
based on Java or Python) but may not know much or anything about
functional programming. After completing this course, one will
have become familiar with recursion in problem-solving and ready
to formulate high-level combinator-based programming solutions.
Have fun as programming is meant to be fun!
