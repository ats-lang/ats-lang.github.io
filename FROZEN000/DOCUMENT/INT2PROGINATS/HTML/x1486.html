>&#13;A reference is just a singleton array, that is, an array containing one
element.  Given a type T, a reference for storing a value of the type T is
given the type ref(T).  The following simple program makes use of all the
essential functionalities on references:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1489"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>val intr = ref&#60;int&#62; (0) // create a ref and init. it with 0
val () = !intr := !intr + 1 // increase the integer at [intr] by 1
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


The first line creates a reference for storing an integer and initializes
it with the value 0 and then names it <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>intr</FONT
>. Note that this
style of reference creation cannot be separated from its
initialization. The second line updates the reference <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>intr</FONT
> with
its current value plus 1. In general, given a reference r of type ref(T)
for some T, the expression !r means to fetch the value stored at r, which
is of the type T. However, !r can also be used as a left-value. For
instance, the assignment (!r := exp) means to evaluate exp into a value and
then store the value into r. Therefore, the value stored in
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>intr</FONT
> is 1 after the second line in the above program is
evaluated.

>&#13;Various functions and function templates on references are declared in the
file <A
HREF="https://github.com/ats-lang/ats-lang.github.io/blob/master/DOCUMENT/ATS-Postiats/prelude/SATS/reference.sats"
TARGET="_top"
>reference.sats</A
>, which
is automatically loaded by <B
CLASS="command"
>atsopt</B
>. In particular, it is
also possible to read from and write to a reference by using the function
templates <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>ref_get_elt</FONT
> and <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>ref_set_elt</FONT
> of the following
interfaces, respectively:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1499"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fun{a:t@ype} ref_get_elt (r: ref a): a // !r
fun{a:t@ype} ref_set_elt (r: ref a, x: a): void // !r := x
</PRE

></P
></DIV

>&#13;References are often misused in practice, especially, by beginners of
functional programming who had some previous exposure to imperative
programming languages such C and Java. Such programmers often think that
they can just "translate" their programs in C or Java into functional
programs. For example, the following defined function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>sumup</FONT
> is
such an example, which sums up all the integers between 1 and a given
integer, inclusive:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1503"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fun sumup
  (n: int): int = let
  val i = ref&#60;int&#62; (1)
  val res = ref&#60;int&#62; (0)
  fun loop (): void =
    if !i &#60;= n then (!res := !res + !i; !i := !i + 1; loop ())
  // end of [loop]
in
  loop (); !res
end // end of [sumup]
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


This is a correct but poor implementation, and its style, though not the
worst of its kind, is deplorable. As references are allocated in heap,
reading from or writing to a reference can be much more time-consuming than
reading from or writing to a register. So, this implementation of
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>sumup</FONT
> is unlikely to be time-efficient.  Every call to
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>sumup</FONT
> creates two references in heap and leaves them there when
it returns, and the memory allocated for such references can only be
reclaimed through garbage collection (GC). So, this implementation of
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>sumup</FONT
> is not memory-efficient.  More importantly, a program
making heavy use of references is often difficult to reason about.
</P
><P
>&#13;I consider references a dangerous feature in functional
programming. If you want to run your program without GC, please do not
create references in the body of a function (besides many other
restrictions). If you find that you are in need of references to
"translate" imperative programs into functional ones, then it is most
likely that you are lost and you have not learned well to program in a
functional style yet.
