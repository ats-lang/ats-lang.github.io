<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
An Amortized Queue Implementation
</h1>

Queues are a common data structure in practice. In the following
presentation, I would like to give a simple 2-list-based implementation of
queues for which both insertion (enqueue) and removal (dequeue) are
guaranteed to be amortized O(1)-time operations.

<h2>
A Simple Interface for Queues
</h2>

Let us first declare as follows a linear abstract type for queues:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
absvtype queue_vtype (a:viewt@ype, n:int) = ptr
vtypedef queue (a:vt0p, n:int) = queue_vtype (a, n)
")</pre>

The full name of the declared abstract type is [queue_vtype] and it is
given an alias [queue]. Given a type T, which may be linear, and an integer
N, the type [queue(T, N)] is for queues containing N elements of type T.

Obviously, N should be a natural number if there is ever a queue of the
type [queue(T, N)]. This is captured by the type of the following function
(or more precisely, proof-function):

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
prfun
lemma_queue_param
  {a:vt0p}{n:int} (que: !queue (a, n)): [n >= 0] void
")</pre>

The following function is to be called to create a queue of size 0:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{} queue_make_nil {a:vt0p} (): queue (a, 0)
")</pre>

By declaring [queue_make_nil] as a function template, we have a better
chance to expect that its definition be inlined during compilation. This
makes sense as [queue_make_nil] should really just be a function of a tiny
body.

<p>

The following function is to be called to destroy a queue of size 0 (and
free the memory it occupies):

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{} queue_free_nil {a:vt0p} (que: queue (a, 0)): void
")</pre>

Clearly, we also need to test whether a given queue is empty. So let us
declare the following function for this purpose:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{}
queue_is_empty
  {a:vt0p}{n:int} (que: !queue (a, n)): bool (n==0)
")</pre>

Similarly, let us declare the following function for testing whether a
given queue is not empty:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{}
queue_isnot_empty
  {a:vt0p}{n:int} (que: !queue (a, n)): bool (n > 0)
")</pre>

As for enqueueing, we declare the following function: 

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:vt0p}
queue_insert_atend{n:int}
  (que: !queue (a, n) >> queue (a, n+1), x: a): void
")</pre>

Note that the syntax indicates that [que] is a call-by-value argument and
the type of the queue it refers to changes from [queue(T, N)] to [queue(T,
N+1)] for some type T and integer N. Obviously, the increased size is due
to one element being inserted into the queue.

<p>

As for dequeueing, we declare the following function: 

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:vt0p}
queue_takeout_atbeg{n:int | n > 0} (que: !queue (a, n) >> queue (a, n-1)): a
")</pre>

Note that the syntax indicates that [que] is a call-by-value argument and
the type of the queue it refers to changes from [queue(T, N)] to [queue(T,
N-1)] for some type T and <em>positive</em> integer N. Obviously, the
decreased size is due to one element being removed from the queue.

<p>

Now it is ready for us to implement the abstract type [queue_vtype] and the functions
associated with it.

<h2>
A 2-List-Based Implementation of Queues
</h2>

In a functional programming setting, a queue is often represented as two
lists: the front part and the rear part. For enqueueing, the rear part is
replaced with a new list whose head is the enqueued element and whose tail
is the original rear part. For dequeueing, if the front part is empty, then
it is first replaced with the reverse of the rear part while the rear part
is replaced with the empty list; if the front part is not empty, then it is
replaced with its own tail while its head is returned as the dequeued
element.

<p>

Clearly, this implementation guarantees that enqueueing is always O(1)-time
but dequeueing may be O(n)-time, where n is the size of the rear part of the
queue. It can also be readily noted that enqueueing and dequeueing are both
O(1)-time if amortized time-complexity is of the concern.

<p>

Let us now see the actual code for this 2-list-based implementation of
queues.  Instead of functional lists, which require the presence of GC to
avoid memory leaks, the code makes use of linear singly-linked lists (of
the type [sllist]), performing memory allocation/deallocation explicitly.

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats('\
staload "libats/SATS/sllist.sats"

datavtype
queue (a:viewt@ype+, n:int) =
  {f,r:nat | f+r==n} QUEUE of (sllist (a, f), sllist (a, r))
// end of [queue]

assume queue_vtype (a, n) = queue (a, n)
')</pre>

Clearly, the above code indicates that the size of a queue equals
the sum of lengths of its front and rear parts.

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{}
queue_make_nil () = QUEUE (sllist_nil (), sllist_nil ())
")</pre>

The function [queue_make_nil] is called to create a queue of size 0, which
consists of an empty front part and an empty rear part.

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{}
queue_free_nil (que) = let
//
val+~QUEUE (f, r) = que
//
prval () = lemma_sllist_param (f)
prval () = lemma_sllist_param (r)
//
prval () = sllist_free_nil (f)
prval () = sllist_free_nil (r)
//
in
  // nothing
end // end of [queue_free_nil]
")</pre>

The function [queue_free_nil] is called to destroy a queue of size 0.
As the elements in a queue may be of a linear type, that is, they may
contain resources, a queue can be safely freed only if it contains no
elements.

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{}
queue_is_empty (que) = let
  val+QUEUE (f, r) = que
in
  if sllist_is_nil (f) then sllist_is_nil (r) else false
end // end of [queue_is_empty]
")</pre>

A queue is empty if and only if both of its front and rear parts are empty.

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{}
queue_isnot_empty (que) = let
  val+QUEUE (f, r) = que
in
  if sllist_is_cons (f) then true else sllist_is_cons (r)
end // end of [queue_isnot_empty]
")</pre>

A queue is not empty if and only if either its front or its rear is not
empty. It is also possible to implement [queue_isnot_empty] directly based
on [queue_is_empty] as is shown below:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{}
queue_isnot_empty (que) = let
  prval () = lemma_queue_param (que) in not (queue_is_empty (que))
end // end of [queue_isnot_empty]
")</pre>

Note that the negation of a value of the type [bool(N == 0)] for some N is
of the type [bool(N != 0)].  In order to show that [N != 0] implies [N >
0], we need to prove that [N >= 0], which is achieved by calling
[lemma_queue_param].

<p>

The functions
[queue_insert_atend]
and
[queue_takeout_atbeg]
are implemented as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement{a}
queue_insert_atend (que, x) = let
//
val+@QUEUE (f, r) = que
val () = r := sllist_cons (x, r)
prval () = fold@ (que)
//
in
  // nothing
end // end of [queue_insert_atend]

implement{a}
queue_takeout_atbeg (que) = let
  val+@QUEUE (f, r) = que
//
val () = lemma_sllist_param (f)
val () = lemma_sllist_param (r)
//
val iscons = sllist_is_cons (f)
//
in
//
if iscons then let
  val x = sllist_uncons (f)
  prval () = fold@ (que)
in
  x
end else let
  prval () = sllist_free_nil (f)
  val () = f := sllist_reverse (r)
  val () = r := sllist_nil {a} ()
  val x = sllist_uncons (f)
  prval () = fold@ (que)
in
  x
end // end of [if]
//
end // end of [queue_takeout_atbeg]
")</pre>

By following the description given at the beginning of this section, one
should find it straightforward to understand the code for enqueueing and
dequeueing.

<p>

For a running implementation, please find in queue-sllist2.dats the
entirety of the above presented code plus some code for testing.
