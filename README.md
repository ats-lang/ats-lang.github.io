## What is ATS?

Let me first paraphrase
[Prof. John Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reynolds).
_A programming language should be simple and general; it should possess
a (highly) efficient implementation and allow for (highly) extensive
error-checking both statically and dynamically_.  And I now add my own.
_A programming language should also (greatly) enhance programming
productivity through its forever expanding meta-programming
support_. ATS aspires to be such a superman programing language, and it
is becoming one.

ATS is a statically typed programming language originally designed to
unify implementation with formal specification. It is equipped with a
highly expressive type system rooted in the framework Applied Type
System, which gives the language its name. In particular, both
dependent types and linear types are available in ATS.
