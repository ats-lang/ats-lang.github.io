Hi,

I am pleased to announce the release of ATS2-0.3.12.

######

First, many thanks to Brandon Barker for his generous
agreement to taking over the duty of packaging and releasing
ATS from this point on.

######

Also, I have started working on ATS3. For this point on,
I do not forsee that major changes or features are to be
added to ATS2 in the future (except library related stuff).
Actually, ATS2 has already been very stable for the past couple
of years. There will be future releases, albeit less and less
frequently.
