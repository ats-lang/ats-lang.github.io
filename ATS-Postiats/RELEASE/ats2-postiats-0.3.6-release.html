<H2>
ats2-postiats-0.3.6:
</H2>

<pre>
This is the 43rd release of ATS2, the successor of the
ATS programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given
the name ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Fixing a bug involving 'reassume': the bug is serious but the fix
   is very minor.
2. Improving utils/atexting by merging atexting_all with atexting_mylib
   Many clients of atexting (e.g., atsccomp-compilers) have been updated
   with respect to the changes maded to atexting.
3. Adding support for compiling a static file followed by a dynamic file
   into a single file consisting of the generated code:
   patsopt -o foo_all.c -s foo.sats -d foo.dats; patscc -o foo foo_all.c
   This support can be useful for distributing C code generated from ATS
   source. For instance, a file of C code generated as such can serve as
   a script of some sort.
4. Adding support for -dd/--dynamics, which compiles a list given files
   in a combined manner.
   For instance, the following command-line:
//
   patsopt -dd foo.dats bar1.dats bar2.dats bar3.dats
//
   essentially compiles a program of the following structure:
//
   local (*nothing*) in #include "foo.dats" end
   local #include "bar1.dats" in (*nothing*) end
   local #include "bar2.dats" in (*nothing*) end
   local #include "bar3.dats" in (*nothing*) end
//
   This style of compilation can be used for the purpose of producing a
   single target containing all of the output generated from compiling a
   list of ATS source files.
5. Disabling tail-call optimization temporarily when try-expression (in
   trywith-expression) is compiled
6. Mandating that an else-clause be present in any ifcase-expression
