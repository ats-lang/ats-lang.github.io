<H2>
ats2-postiats-0.3.5:
</H2>

<pre>
This is the 42nd release of ATS2, the successor of the
ATS programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given
the name ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Fixing a bug in atscc2js that prevented certain compound patterns
   from being handled correctly. Should this be done to other atsccomp
   compilers?
2. Fixing a bug causing linear tuples to be leaked after their use.
   Please see bug-2017-04-16.
3. Fixing a bug in compiling a fix-function defined inside a template.
   Please see bug-2017-04-17.
4. Disallowing non-variable linear patterns used as function arguments
   (due to potential memory leaks):
   For instance,
   fun foo($tup(x, y)): ... = ...
   needs to be written as
   fun foo(xy): ... = let $tup(x, y) = xy in ... end
5. Adding myatscc-support (in utils/myatscc)
   for allowing compilation commands being embedded inside source code.
   For instance, the following comment can be included to support using
   ATS as a scripting language:
   (*
   ##myatsccdef=\
   patsopt --constraint-ignore --dynamic $1 | \
   tcc -run -DATS_MEMALLOC_LIBC -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime - $arglst(2)
   *)
6. Adding ats1-libatsopt (npm-package)
7. Adding contrib/atscntrb-hx-getargs for building command-line support
8. Adding ATS-Postiats/npm-util/libats-hwxi/OpenSCAD:
   Supporting meta-programming for OpenSCAD, that is, writing programs in
   ATS for generating OpenSCAD code (that can create models for 3D-printing)
