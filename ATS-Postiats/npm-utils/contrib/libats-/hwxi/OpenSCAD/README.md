# Meta-Programming for OpenSCAD in ATS

## Project Description

This package was orginally implemented for teaching BUCS320
during the summer of 2017. It demonstrates a functional style
of meta-programming in ATS for generating code that creates
models in OpenSCAD. Please see the examples in the TEST directory
to get started. Have fun with 3D-printing!
