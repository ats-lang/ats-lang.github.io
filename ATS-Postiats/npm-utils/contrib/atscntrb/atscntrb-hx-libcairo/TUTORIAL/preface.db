ATS is a rich programming language equipped with a highly expressive type
system for specifying and enforcing program invariants. In particular, both
dependent and linear types are available in ATS to support practical
programming.  ATS/Cairo provide an API in ATS for

a comprehensive drawing package supporting 2D graphics. While there are
already many on-line tutorials on using cairo (e.g., <ulink
url="http://www.cairographics.org/tutorial">this one</ulink>), the current
one focuses on employing types in ATS to facilitate safe and reliable
programming with cairo.  In particular, it is demonstrated concretely here
that linear types can be used effectively to prevent resources (e.g.,
contexts and surfaces created for drawing) from being leaked due to
programming errors. The reader of the tutorial is assumed to have already
acquired certain level of familiarity with ATS.
