This is the 50th release of ATS2, the successor of the
ATS programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given
the name ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Fixing the issue of escaping '$' in PHP string literals (atscc2php)
   Kudos to M88!
2. Fixing very minor issues in libats/qlist and libats/linmap
3. Enforcing that no d2var can be leaked/exported from a namespace

Please note that starting in this release, there are two variants of the package
released: the "gmp" variant depends on the GMP library. The "int" variant does
not depend on the GMP library. In this release ATS2-Postiats-0.3.13.tgz is just
the same as ATS2-Postiats-gmp-0.3.13.tgz. This is subject to change in future
releases, as most users (especially new users) can get by without the extra
dependency on GMP.

0.3.6

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Fixing a bug involving 'reassume': the bug is serious but the fix
   is very minor.
2. Improving utils/atexting by merging atexting_all with atexting_mylib
   Many clients of atexting (e.g., atsccomp-compilers) have been updated
   with respect to the changes maded to atexting.
3. Adding support for compiling a static file followed by a dynamic file
   into a single file consisting of the generated code:
   patsopt -o foo_all.c -s foo.sats -d foo.dats; patscc -o foo foo_all.c
   This support can be useful for distributing C code generated from ATS
   source. For instance, a file of C code generated as such can serve as
   a script of some sort.
4. Adding support for -dd/--dynamics, which compiles a list of given files
   in a combined manner. For instance, the following command-line:
//
   patsopt -dd foo.dats bar1.dats bar2.dats bar3.dats
//
   essentially compiles a program of the following structure:
//
   local (*nothing*) in #include "foo.dats" end
   local #include "bar1.dats" in (*nothing*) end
   local #include "bar2.dats" in (*nothing*) end
   local #include "bar3.dats" in (*nothing*) end
//
   This style of compilation can be used for the purpose of producing a
   single target containing all of the output generated from compiling a
   list of ATS source files.
5. Disabling tail-call optimization temporarily when try-expression (in
   trywith-expression) is compiled
6. Mandating that an else-clause be present in any ifcase-expression:
   ifcase
   | test1 => ...
   | test2 => ...
   | _(*else*) => ... // this is the else-clause here

   Please see bug-2017-04-16.
3. Fixing a bug in compiling a fix-function defined inside a template.
   Please see bug-2017-04-17.
4. Disallowing non-variable linear patterns used as function arguments
   (due to potential memory leaks):

   needs to be written as
   fun foo(xy): ... = let $tup(x, y) = xy in ... end
5. Adding myatscc-support (in utils/myatscc)
   for allowing compilation commands being embedded inside source code.
   For instance, the following comment can be included to support using
   ATS as a scripting language:
   (*
   ##myatsccdef=\
   patsopt --constraint-ignore --dynamic $1 | \
   tcc -run -DATS_MEMALLOC_LIBC -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime - $arglst(2)
   *)
6. Adding ats1-libatsopt (npm-package)
7. Adding contrib/atscntrb-hx-getargs for building command-line support
8. Adding ATS-Postiats/npm-util/libats-hwxi/OpenSCAD:
   Supporting meta-programming for OpenSCAD, that is, writing programs in
   ATS for generating OpenSCAD code (that can create models for 3D-printing)

   implementation may cause the need for $tempenver to change. It is
   not yet understood what the reason is behind all of this behavior.
*)

   function hidexp_seq_simplify for details.

   This feature is mostly for interacting ATS with other languages.

   This feature makes it very convenient for ATS to interact with OOP.

4. Adding support for extvar decl. (which is different from $extval):
   extval "external_name" = internal_value

   dynloading SATS-files is no longer necessary (but it is still harmless).

0.0.2

Date: September 19, 2013

This is the second release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name
ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Support for classdec.
   This feature is primarily for building APIs in ATS for external
   packages written in the OOP-style.

2. Support for ATS-package relocation.
   This feature is primarily for renaming and relocating external ATS
   packages (mostly library APIs). It is supposed to work together with
   atspkgreloc, a tool that does the actual package relocation. The tool
   is yet to be implemented.

3. Support for dot-notation overloading:
//
   symintr .x .y
   extern fun point_get_x (p: point): int
   extern fun point_get_y (p: point): int
   overload .x with point_get_x
   overload .y with point_get_y
//
   These declarations enable the following:
   [p.x] translates into [point_get_x(p)]
   [p.y] translates into [point_get_y(p)]

4. Fixing a very serious bug in pattern-matching compilation

5. Relocating contributed packages from ats2-lang to ats2-lang-contrib

6. Improving atslib: adding code, fixing bugs, improving documentation, etc.

0.0.1

September 2, 2013

This is the first release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name
ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

The actual implementation of ATS2 started in the March of 2011, and
it took about two and one-half years to reach this stage. As of now,
the code base for the compiler of ATS2 consists of 140,000+ lines of
code (LOC), which are nearly all written in ATS1.

When compared to ATS1, the single most important new feature is the
template system of ATS2. This is a feature that could potentially change
the way a programmer writes his or her code. One can certainly feel that
this is a very powerful feature (a bit like feeling that OOP is a very
powerful feature). However, how this feature should be properly and
effectively used in practice needs a lot more investigation.

Another thing about ATS2 is that it is a lot leaner than ATS1. One can
make good use of ATS2 without any need for compiled library (libatslib.a).
Also, GC support in ATS2 becomes optional; if needed, third-party GC (e.g.,
Bohem-GC) can be readily employed.

I will gradually list differences between ATS1 and ATS2, helping people
make the transition from ATS1 to ATS2.
