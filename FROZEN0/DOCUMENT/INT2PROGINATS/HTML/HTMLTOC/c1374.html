>&#13;Effectful programming features are those that can generate effects at
run-time. But what is really an effect? The answer to this question is
rather complex as it depends on the model of evaluation. I will gradually
introduce various kinds of effects in this book. In sequential programming,
that is, constructing programs to be evaluated sequentially (in contrast to
concurrently), an expression is effectless if there exists a value such
that the expression and the value cannot be distinguished as far as
evaluation is concerned. For instance, the expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1+2</FONT
> is
effectless as it cannot be distinguished from the value <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>3</FONT
>. An
effectless expression is also said to be pure.  On the other hand, an
effectful expression is one that can be distinguished from any given
values. For instance, the expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>print("Hello")</FONT
> is
effectful as its evaluation results in an observable behavior that
distinguishes the expression from any values.  In this case,
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>print("Hello")</FONT
> is said to certain I/O effect.  If the
evaluation of an expression never terminates, then the expression is also
effectul. For instance, let us define a function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>loop</FONT
> as
follows:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1382"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fun loop (): void = loop ()
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


Then the expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>loop()</FONT
> can be distinguished from
any values in the following context:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1385"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>let val _ = [] in print ("Terminated") end</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


If the hole <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>[]</FONT
> in the context is replaced with
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>loop()</FONT
>, then the evaluation of the resulting expression
continues forever.  If the hole <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>[]</FONT
> is replaced with any value,
then the evaluation leads to the string "Terminated" being printed out.
The expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>loop</FONT
> is said to contain non-termination effect.

>&#13;I will cover programming features related to exceptional control-flow,
persistent memory storage and simple I/O in this chapter, which are all of
common use in practical programming.

><P
>&#13;The exception mechanism provides an efficient means for reporting a special
condition encountered during program evaluation. Often such a special
condition indicates an error, but it is not uncommon to employ exceptions
to address issues that are not related to errors.
</P
><P
>&#13;The type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>exn</FONT
> is predefined in ATS. One may think of
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>exn</FONT
> as an extensible datatype for which new constructors can
always be declared. For instance, two exception constructors are declared
as follows:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1400"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>exception FatalError0 of ()
exception FatalError1 of (string)
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


The constructor <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>FatalError0</FONT
> is nullary while the constructor
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>FatalError1</FONT
> is unary.  Exception values, that is, values of
the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>exn</FONT
> can be formed by applying exception constructors
to proper arguments. For instance, <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>FatalError0()</FONT
> and
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>FatalError1("division-by-zero")</FONT
> are two exception values (or
simply exceptions). In the following program, a function for integer
division is implemented:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1407"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>exception DivisionByZero of ()
fun divexn (x: int, y: int): int =
  if y != 0 then x / y else $raise DivisionByZero()
// end of [divexn]
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


When the function call <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>divexn(1, 0)</FONT
> is evaluated, the exception
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>DivisionByZero()</FONT
> is raised. The keyword <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>$raise</FONT
> in ATS
is solely for raising exceptions.
</P
><P
>&#13;A raise-expression is of the form (<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>$raise</FONT
> exp) for some
expression exp.  Clearly, if the evaluation of exp returns a value, then
the evaluation of (<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>$raise</FONT
> exp) leads to a raised
exception. Therefore, the evaluation of a raise-expression can never return
a value, and this justifies that a raise-expression can be given any type.
</P
><P
>&#13;A raised exception can be captured. If it is not captured, the raised
exception aborts the program evaluation that issued it in the first
place. In ATS, a try-expression (or try-with-expression) is of the form
(<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>try</FONT
> exp <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>with</FONT
> clseq), where <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>try</FONT
> is a
keyword, exp is an expression, <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>with</FONT
> is also a keyword, and
clseq is a sequence of matching clauses. When evaluating such a
try-expression, we first evaluate exp. If the evaluation of exp leads to a
value, then the value is also the value of the try-expression. If the
evaluation of exp leads to a raised exception, then we match the exception
against the guards of the matching clauses in clseq. If there is a match,
the raised exception is caught and we continue to evaluate the body of the
first clause whose guard is matched. If there is no match, the raised
exception is uncaught. In a try-expression, the with-part is often referred
to as an exception-handler.
</P
><P
>Let us now see an example that involves raising and capturing an
exception. In the following program, three functions are defined to compute
the product of the integers in a given list:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1421"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fun listprod1
(
  xs: list0 (int)
) : int =
(
  case+ xs of
  | list0_nil () =&#62; 1
  | list0_cons (x, xs) =&#62; x * listprod1 (xs)
) (* end of [listprod1] *)

fun listprod2
(
  xs: list0 (int)
) : int =
(
  case+ xs of
  | list0_nil () =&#62; 1
  | list0_cons (x, xs) =&#62;
      if x = 0 then 0 else x * listprod2 (xs)
    // end of [list0_cons]
) (* end of [listprod2] *)

fun listprod3
(
  xs: list0 (int)
) : int = let
  exception ZERO of ()
  fun aux (xs: list0 (int)): int =
    case+ xs of
    | list0_cons (x, xs) =&#62;
        if x = 0 then $raise ZERO() else x * aux (xs)
    | list0_nil () =&#62; 1
  // end of [aux]
in
  try aux (xs) with ~ZERO () =&#62; 0
end // end of [listprod3]
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


While these functions can all be defined tail-recursively, they are not so
as to make a point that should be clear shortly. Undoubtedly, we all know the
following simple fact:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>If the integer 0 occurs in a given list, then the product
of the integers in the list is 0 regardless what other integers are.
</P
></LI
></UL
>

The function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod1</FONT
> is defined in a standard manner, and it
does not make any use of the stated fact.  The function
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod2</FONT
> is defined in a manner that makes only partial use of
the stated fact. To see the reason, let us evaluate a call to
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod2</FONT
> on <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>[1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 6]</FONT
>, which denotes a
list consisting of the 7 mentioned integers. The evaluation of this call
eventually leads to the evaluation of
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1*(2*(3*(listprod([0,4,5,6]))))</FONT
>, which then leads to
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1*(2*(3*0))</FONT
>, and then to <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1*(2*0)</FONT
>, and then to
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1*0</FONT
>, and finally to <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>0</FONT
>. However, what we really want
is for the evaluation to return 0 immediately once the integer 0 is
encountered in the list, and this is accomplished by the function
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod3</FONT
>. When evaluating a call to <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod3</FONT
> on
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>[1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 6]</FONT
>, we eventually reach the evaluation of
the following expression:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN1438"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>try 1*(2*(3*(aux([0,4,5,6])))) with ~ZERO() =&#62; 0
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>


Evaluating <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>aux([0,4,5,6])</FONT
> leads to the exception
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>ZERO()</FONT
> being raised, and this raised exception is caught and
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>0</FONT
> is returned as the value of the call to
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>listprod3</FONT
>.  Note that the pattern guard of the matching clause
following the keyword <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>with</FONT
> is <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>~ZERO()</FONT
>.  I will
explain the need for the tilde symbol <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>~</FONT
> elsewhere. For now, it
suffices to say that <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>exn</FONT
> is a linear type and each exception
value is a linear value, which must be consumed or re-raised. The tilde
symbol <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>~</FONT
> indicates that the value matching the pattern
following <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>~</FONT
> is consumed (and the memory for holding the value
is freed).

>&#13;Exceptions are not a programming feature that is easy to master, and
misusing exceptions is abundant in practice. So please be patient when
learning the feature and be cautious when using it.
