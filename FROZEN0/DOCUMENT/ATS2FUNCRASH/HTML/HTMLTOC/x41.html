>&#13;Learning ATS can help a programmer greatly enhance his or her
programming productivity.

</P
><P
>&#13;For most people, learning basic programming is easy and fun but there
seems to be no clear path for one to ever reach the level of a
programming expert who can confidently design and implement large and
complex software systems. It is very common to see that the initial
excitement one receives from some sort of exposure to programming is
quickly replaced with the endless need for debugging. And one may even
draw the conclusion that the only way to obtain functioning code of
quality is by going through a lengthy debugging process, which of course
is far from the truth.

</P
><P
>&#13;In this book, I will be primarily using ATS as a vehicle to teach a
style of programing that is often referred to as functional
programming (FP).  In particular, I will be advocating the use of
recursion in problem-solving as well as the need to prevent potential
stack overflow caused by deeply nested recursive function calls.  I
will also be demonstrating concretely and repeatedly that one can
drastically reduce the need for debugging by making extensive use of
types in programming.
