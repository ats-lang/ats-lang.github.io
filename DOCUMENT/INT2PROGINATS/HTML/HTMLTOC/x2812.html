>&#13;A red-black tree is defined as a binary tree such that each node in it is
colored red or black and every path from the root to a leaf has the same
number of black nodes while containing no occurrences of two red nodes in a
row.  Clearly, the length of a longest path in each red-black tree is
bounded by 2 times the length of a shortest path in it. Therefore,
red-black trees are a family of balanced trees. The number of black nodes
occurring on each path in a red-black tree is often referred to as the
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>black height</I
></SPAN
> of the tree.

</P
><P
>&#13;Formally, a datatype precisely for red-black trees can be declared in ATS
as follows:

</P

CLASS="informalexample"

  (a:t@ype+, int(*clr*), int(*bh*)) =
  | rbtree_nil (a, BLK, 0)
  | {c,cl,cr:clr | cl &#60;= 1-c; cr &#60;= 1-c} {bh:nat}
    rbtree_cons (a, c, bh+1-c) of (int c, rbtree (a, cl, bh), a, rbtree (a, cr, bh))
// end of [rbtree]
</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>&#13;The color of a tree is the color of its root node or is black if the tree
is empty.  Given a type T, a color C (represented by a integer) and an
integer BH, the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree(T, C, BH)</FONT
> is for red-black trees
carrying elements of the type T that is of the color C and the black height
BH.

</P
><P
>&#13;When implementing various operations (such as insertion and deletion) on a
red-black tree, we often need to first construct intermediate trees that
contain color violations caused by a red node being followed by another red
node and then employ tree rotations to fix such violations. This need makes
the above datatype <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree</FONT
> too rigid as it cannot be assigned to
any intermediate trees containing color violations. To address this issue,
we can declare <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree</FONT

      {c==BLK &#38;&#38; v==0 || c == RED &#38;&#38; v==cl+cr}
    rbtree_cons (a, c, bh+1-c, v) of
    (
      int c, rbtree0 (a, cl, bh), a, rbtree0 (a, cr, bh)
    ) (* end of [rbtree_cons] *)
// end of [rbtree]

where rbtree0 (a:t@ype, c:int, bh:int) = rbtree (a, c, bh, 0)

</PRE

><P
>&#13;We count each occurrence of two red nodes in a row as one color violation.
Given a type T, a color C (represented by a integer), an integer BH and an
integer V, the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree(T, C, BH, V)</FONT
> is for trees carrying
elements of the type T that is of the color C and the black height BH and
contains exactly V color violations. Therefore, the type
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree(T, C, BH, 0)</FONT
> is for valid red-black trees (containing no
color violations).

tree containing no violations, the following operation constructs a valid

>&#13;The preparation for implementing insertion on a red-black tree is all done
by now, and we are ready to see an implementation of insertion guaranteeing
that the tree obtained from inserting an element into a given red-black
tree is always a valid red-black tree itself. This guarantee is precisely
captured in the following interface for insertion:

>&#13;Note that the type assigned to the inner function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>ins</FONT
> is so
informative that it literally gives an formal explanation about the way in
which insertion works on a red-black tree. Many a programmer implements
red-black trees by simply following an algorithm written in some format of
pseudo code while having little understanding about the innerworkings of
the algorithm. For instance, if the above inner function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>ins</FONT
> is
implemented in C, few programmers are likely to see that the function
always maintain the black height of a given red-black tree after insertion
but may introduce one color violation if the root of the tree is red. On
the other hand, knowing this invariant is essential to gaining a thorough
understanding of the insertion algorithm on red-black trees.

</P
><P
>&#13;The insertion operation implemented above does not insert an element if it
is already in the given red-black tree. It may be desirable to require that
the operation inform the caller if such a case occurs. For instance, an
exception can be raised for this purpose. An alternative is to give
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>rbtree_insert</FONT
> a call-by-reference argument so that a flag can be
returned in it to indicate whether the element to be inserted is actually
inserted. I will explain elsewhere what call-by-reference is and how it is
supported in ATS.

</P
><P
>&#13;Often deleting an element from a binary search tree is significantly more
difficult to implement than inserting one.  This is especially so in the
case of a red-black tree.  I refer the interested reader to the libats
library of ATS for some code implementing a deletion operation on red-black
trees that can guarantee based on types each tree returned by the operation
being a valid red-black tree (containing no color violations).
